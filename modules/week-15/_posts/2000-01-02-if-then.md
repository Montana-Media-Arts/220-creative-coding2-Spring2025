## Playground If/Then  

One of the most powerful aspects if the if statements in the Unity Playground. We will experiment with one.

1. In the Scripts folder, navigate to the ***Conditions*** folder.
2. Select the main player.
3. Find the ***ConditionArea*** script and add it to the Inspector of the main player.
4. Next, find the ***DialogueBalloonAction*** and add that to the main player.
5. In the Condition Area (in the Inspector), select Tag to Check for, ***Enemy***
6. In the Gameplay Actions, select Dialogue Balloon Action.
7. In the Dialogue Balloon, drag one of the enemies into the ***Target Object***
8. Change the collision on the enemy so that ***Is Trigger*** is selected. 

## Test it!

Click Run and see if the dialogue appears!
