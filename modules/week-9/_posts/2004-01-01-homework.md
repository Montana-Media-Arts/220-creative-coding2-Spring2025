# Homework

In this homework, you are going to use the p5.play library and create a game.  You are welcome to rework your existing game or create a new one. I am open to either.

Specifics:

1. Use the p5.play library to create animations.
2. Move the player in different directions using different keys (WASD or arrows).
3. Display the immovable objects in random locations when the program starts (at least 3).
4. Prevent the player from walking through them.
5. Have collectible items.
6. Have items items that will decrease health.
7. If the player collects an item, increase the score.
8. The health decreases if the player collides with a "bad" item.
9. If the player's score reaches 10, they win.
10. If the player's health reaches 0, they lose.
11. Submit all the files into your repository.
12. Turn in your repository link to Moodle.
