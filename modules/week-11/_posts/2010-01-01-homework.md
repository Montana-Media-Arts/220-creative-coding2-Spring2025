# Homework

In this homework assignment, you will extend your assignment one more time, and when you attack a bad object, it should have an integrated particle system. You win the game once all the "enemies” have been destroyed.  Eating good food still increases your score.

2. There should be at least five good pieces of food.

6. Submit files to your GitHub repository.
7. Submit the repository link to Canvas.
