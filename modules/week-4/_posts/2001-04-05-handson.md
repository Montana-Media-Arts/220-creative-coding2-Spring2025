# Hands On Exercise

In this exercise, you are going to create a small game where there are two images on the screen. The first image is controlled by the player.  The second image is moves asynchronously, but follows the player.  

There should be a timer that counts down from 10 for each wave.  After each wave, the the following image should move a little faster toward the player. If the player is hit, then the game is over.  

Each wave should be recorded and displayed on the screen.  The text should use a fun font as well.  You can use an image found online, one from your personal library or a Generative AI image.  Be mindful of where you get your image.
