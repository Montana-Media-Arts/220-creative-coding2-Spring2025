# Homework

Please continue working your previous homework.

1. Create a class for your food.
2. Have all the properties of the food in the food class.
3. Have a function in the food class that makes the food appear randomly on the screen (if you have multiple food items, choose one - choose an easy one).
4. Create an object of the food class in your main sketch.
5. Use the simple collision so that the food is eaten when the character runs into the food.
6. Ensure a proper directory structure with an images folder, js folder, libs folder, etc., exists in the homework folder.
7. Upload all your folders and files to GitHub and turn your link into Canvas.
