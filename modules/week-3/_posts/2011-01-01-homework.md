# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to iterate on your first assignment and make it interactive (focus on keyboard or mouse for now).  Continue to use basic shapes to make it appear. Just make sure there is some basic movement as well.

Feel free to use each of these assignments as opportunity to tell your story.

Again, have ChatGPT or Copilot create something as well (in p5.js).  Write a short reflection on what it created.  What did you learn?  Is it useful?  Was it helpful or unhelpful? 

<!--
continue working with basic shapes in p5.js.  We are going to now formally incorporate control statements and variables. Whenever the program calls the draw method, keep track of the count. Every time the number exceeds a multiple of 1000, have your program change shapes and color. Put the shapes in random locations.

It should have the following properties:

1. Your name should be in the lower right-hand corner
2. You should name your piece and have it on the upper-left hand corner.
3. Some of the shapes should move randomly to different locations.
4. Incorporate event handling (mouse/keyboard events) into your piece.
5. Use control statements where appropriate.
6. Have ChatGPT/Copilot create something as well in p5.js
7. Write a reflection paper about what ChatGPT created vs what you created.
8. Upload all your files to your repository. 3 files - your sketch, the sketch generated from ChatGPT/Copilot, short reflection paper.
9. Submit your repository link to Moodle.

<!--
1. Border around the edge of your window
2. Use at least 10 different shapes of varying sizes
3.	The border should be one solid color
4.	The shapes inside the frame should be different colors.
5.	Your name should be in the lower right-hand corner
6.	You should name your piece and have it on the upper-left hand corner.
1.	Keep the border around the edge of your window.
2.	You should use random to move your shapes into different locations within your border.
3.	You should move shapes whenever the counter is greater than a multiple 1000.
4.	Whenever the shapes move, they should also change shape type and color.
5.	Use if statements.
