# Homework

In this assignment, you will iterate on your first assignment and make it interactive (focus on keyboard or mouse for now). Continue to use basic shapes to make it appear. Just make sure there is some basic movement as well.

Feel free to use each assignment as an opportunity to tell your story.

Again, have ChatGPT or Copilot create something (in p5.js). Please write a short reflection on what it created. What did you learn? Is it useful? Was it helpful or unhelpful?

It should have the following properties:

1. Your name should be in the lower right-hand corner
2. You should name your piece and have it in the upper-left-hand corner.
3. Some of the shapes should move randomly to different locations.
4. Incorporate event handling (mouse/keyboard events) into your piece.
5. Use control statements where appropriate.
6. Have ChatGPT/Copilot create something as well in p5.js
7. Write a reflection paper about what ChatGPT created vs what you created.
8. Upload all your files to your repository. 3 files - your sketch, the sketch generated from ChatGPT/Copilot/Gemini, and a short reflection paper.
9. Submit your repository link to Canvas.
